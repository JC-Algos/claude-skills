## Reporter Agent Removed
- Reporter (Sonnet) was unreliable — acknowledged cron triggers but never executed scripts
- Jason confirmed: "He missed every firing"
- All 8 cron jobs reassigned back to Oracle (agentId: "main")
- Reporter agent fully removed from config, bindings, Telegram accounts
- REPORTER_BRIEF.md deleted, AGENTS.md + SOUL.md updated (4→3 agents)
- Now 3 agents: Oracle 🐷, WebDev 🌐, Coder 💻
- Lesson: Sonnet not reliable for cron job execution

## Cron Jobs Executed Successfully by Oracle
- HK News Summary: 15:00, 16:00, 18:00 HKT — all delivered to TG + 2 WhatsApp groups
- HK BB Squeeze 1h: ran, 0 squeezes found, posted to TG
- Short Selling Report: ran, delivered to TG + DIM INV WhatsApp
- Short Selling History: SFC + HKEX data saved
- wacli lock issue: need to kill existing wacli sync process before sending

## TradingView Signal Page Fixed
- Telethon SESSION_STRING died after Jason's TG account reset
- Bots can't read channel history via MTProto (GetHistoryRequest blocked for bots)
- Generated new user session string for Jason's new TG account (+85290197440)
- 2FA password: Sandy01030411
- TG blocks login codes shared via Telegram itself (security feature) — had to use disguised codes
- New session: `1BVtsOHUBu564A8D...` (in app.py)

## Signal Page Deployment
- Backend: Docker container `n8n-signal-web-1` on this VPS
- Added to `/docker/n8n/docker-compose.yml` as `signal-web` service
- URL: https://signal.srv1295571.hstgr.cloud/
- Frontend + backend both served from VPS (Flask serves static files)
- Hostinger has separate files: `JC_Signals.html`, `app.js`, `style.css` (flat structure, no subfolders)
- Hostinger app.js API_BASE must point to: `https://signal.srv1295571.hstgr.cloud`
- Auth: Uses Supabase (same as main site) — `checkUserAccess()` pattern from technical.html
- GitHub: https://github.com/JC-Algos/Signal_page-Transition (hostinger/ folder for Hostinger files)

## Yahoo Finance Fix
- yfinance 0.2.33 was broken for HK stocks — all tickers failing
- Upgraded to yfinance 1.1.0 in container — fixed
- Updated docker-compose to use `yfinance` (latest) instead of pinned old version

## Valid Signal Logic ✅ CONFIRMED
- 看好 + normal strategies: valid if 收市價 ≥ 觸發價
- 看好 + Magic 9/13: valid if 收市價 ≤ 觸發價 (reversed)
- 看淡 + normal: valid if 收市價 ≤ 觸發價
- 看淡 + Magic 9/13: valid if 收市價 ≥ 觸發價 (reversed)
- Jason confirmed correct on 2026-02-05

## TradingView Signal Brainstorm
- Jason interested in: AI Signal Commentary (#2) + WhatsApp Signal Delivery (#3)
- Current flow: TradingView → TG Bot API → Channel post
- Signal page reads from channel via Telethon
- Future: intercept signals, enrich with AI, forward to WhatsApp

## Hostinger File Structure (jc-algos.com)
- All files flat in root (no subfolders)
- Key files: index.html (home), JC_Signals.html (signal page), technical.html, indicators.html
- JS: app.js, main.js, api.js, supabase-config.js
- CSS: style.css
- Auth: Supabase with checkUserAccess() / checkPremiumStatus()
