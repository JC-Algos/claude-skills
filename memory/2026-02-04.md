## Telegram Bot Migration
- **New bot:** @Oracle_Piggybot (8225795790)
- **Old bot:** 8500544907 - token expired/invalid
- Jason's account: Sand Tai (id: 90197440)
- System shows 7775867639 but Jason confirms it's 90197440

## Sentiment Analysis Fix
**Problem:** market_sentiment.py was missing, causing stale data for 24hrs

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- File was committed to `master` branch (cf584c4)
- But working branch was `main`
- File existed in git history but not in working directory
- Cron job failed silently: "No such file or directory"

**Timeline:**
- Feb 3 03:56 - Script ran successfully, JSON updated
- Feb 3 03:57 - Git commit on master branch
- Feb 3 04:37 - Switched from master to main branch
- Feb 3 07:30+ - All cron jobs failed (file missing)

**Fix:**
1. Restored file from git: `git show cf584c4:projects/market-analyzer/sentiment/market_sentiment.py`
2. Committed to main branch
3. Deleted master and feature/sentiment-fix branches
4. Now only `main` branch exists

## BB Squeeze Scanner Cleanup
- Deleted non-RRG scripts: hsi_hourly_scan.py, hsi_daily_scan.py, hsi_bb_squeeze_scanner*.py
- Only use RRG format: `hk_squeeze_rrg_analyzer.py`, `squeeze_rrg_analyzer.py`
- RRG reports BREAKOUTS only, not in-squeeze stocks

## TOOLS.md Restructure
Created sub-files in `memory/tools/`:
- n8n-workflows.md - All n8n workflows and APIs
- tg-whatsapp-summaries.md - BB+RRG, News, delivery targets
- hsi-forecast.md - 4 Judges prediction system
- accounts.md - Jason's accounts, channels, WhatsApp groups

## wacli Issue
- `wacli sync --follow` locks the store
- Must kill sync process before sending: `pkill -f "wacli sync"`
- Don't run sync continuously

## Key Learnings
1. Always check which git branch you're on before committing
2. Verify cron job logs when scheduled tasks fail silently
3. Use memory/tools/ sub-files for organized recall
4. RRG format only for BB Squeeze reports

## Market Sentiment n8n Flow Fix (07:17-07:23 UTC)

**Issue**: Jason reported sentiment data unchanged for 4 hours in email

**Root cause**: n8n workflow had duplicate triggers:
- System cron → Python script → webhook ✅
- n8n schedule trigger → stale cached data ❌

**Fix**: Removed n8n schedule trigger connections via mcporter
```bash
mcporter call n8n.update_workflow workflowId:M6GuLyuCliDOSTg8 connections:...
```

**Learning logged**: `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` [LRN-20260204-001]
**Docs updated**: `memory/tools/n8n-workflows.md`
