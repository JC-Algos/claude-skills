## Stock Analysis System Improvements

### TA Report Format
- Added section dividers (`─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─`) between sections for better readability
- Renamed "相對強度 (RS) 排名" → "相對強度排名 (Relative Strength Rank)"
- Standardized output format in code (not interpreted by Oracle each time)
- Added `/analyze/complete` endpoint that returns report + technical chart + RRG chart paths

### Technical Chart (`generate_chart.py`)
- EMA colors changed to blue tones (light→deep, thin→thick):
  - EMA10: `#87CEEB` (light sky blue), width=1
  - EMA20: `#4169E1` (royal blue), width=1.5
  - EMA60: `#0066CC` (medium blue), width=2.5
  - EMA200: `#00008B` (deep navy), width=5
- Fixed legend to match actual line colors and widths using custom `Line2D` handles

### RRG Chart (`rrg_rs_analyzer.py`)
- Fixed 100 as center point for both axes
- All four quadrants fully colored (dynamic range based on data, min ±10)
- Chinese quadrant labels with 2x larger font (fontsize=22):
  - 領先 (Leading) - green
  - 改善中 (Improving) - blue
  - 落後 (Lagging) - red
  - 轉弱 (Weakening) - orange
- Added Chinese font support: `Noto Sans CJK JP` (installed `fonts-noto-cjk`)
- Title shows Chinese benchmark name (標普500指數 / 恆生指數)

### n8n Workflow Updated
- "Stock Technical Analyzer" workflow now uses `/analyze/complete` endpoint
- Combine Reports node updated to handle chart paths
