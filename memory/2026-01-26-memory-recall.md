[Telegram Jason (@jasonckb) id:1016466977 +1m 2026-01-26 23:51 UTC] shouldi need to recall the date so you can search the memory?
[message_id: 739]
assistant: Nope! I have two ways to recall things:

**1. Semantic Search** (automatic)
I can search by topic across *all* memory files. So if you ask:
- "What did we fix with Stripe?"
- "How did we solve the n8n Docker issue?"
- "What's the BB Squeeze progress?"

I'll find it without needing the date.

**2. Direct Date Lookup**
If you *do* mention a date, I can read that specific file directly.

---

**TL;DR:** Just ask about the topic — I'll find it. Dates help narrow it down but aren't required. 🐷

assistant: Sounds good! Just type `/new` and you'll get a fresh session.

Everything from today is saved in memory — I'll remember the important stuff. See you on the other side! 🐷
