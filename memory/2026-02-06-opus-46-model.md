## Conversation Summary

assistant: Nice! It's on claude.ai but **Clawdbot uses the API** (your token), not the web interface.

The API model ID might be `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` — want me to try updating the config? 

Could also try `/model anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` to see if it accepts it.

⚠️ Risk: If the model ID doesn't exist in the API yet, requests will fail.

assistant: Clawdbot doesn't know about Opus 4.6 yet:

```
Available models:
- anthropic/claude-opus-4-5
- anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
```

**Two issues:**
1. Clawdbot needs an update to support new model IDs
2. Your `claude-cli` OAuth token is expired (doctor showed this earlier)

**To fix:**
1. Run `claude setup-token` on the VPS to refresh OAuth
2. Wait for Clawdbot update to add opus-4-6 to allowed models list

Or we can try forcing it manually in config — want me to try adding `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` to the allowed models? Might work if the API accepts it. 🐷
