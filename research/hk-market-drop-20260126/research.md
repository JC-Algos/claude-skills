## 2. MAIN CATALYSTS

### A. Geopolitical Tensions (Primary Driver)

**Evidence:**
- SCMP explicitly cited "geopolitical tensions" as main market factor
- Safe-haven assets (gold, silver) surged to new highs
- Investor rotation into Chinese equities as hedge against US market volatility
- Yuan strengthened through psychologically important 7.0/USD level (first time since mid-2023)

**Possible Factors:**
- US-China tensions (likely ongoing or escalated)
- Trump administration's claimed "Greenland deal" framework mentioned in earlier reports (January 22)

## CONCLUSION

January 26, 2026 saw Hong Kong markets displaying significant volatility and divergence, with the Hang Seng Tech Index underperforming by declining 1.3% while the main HSI traded nearly flat. The session was characterized by:

1. **Geopolitical uncertainty** driving safe-haven flows into gold/silver
2. **Tech sector weakness** amid US-China tensions and risk-off sentiment  
3. **Defensive rotation** into property stocks and precious metals
4. **Mainland resilience** with Chinese markets showing relative strength
5. **Yuan strength** breaking through 7.0/USD, reflecting dollar concerns

The tech sector's particular weakness appears driven by heightened geopolitical risk premiums, regulatory uncertainty, and investor rotation toward defensive assets. However, the robust IPO market and PBOC easing signals suggest medium-term structural support remains in place.

**Key Takeaway:** Today's price action reflects short-term risk aversion and geopolitical jitters rather than fundamental deterioration in Chinese tech or the Hong Kong market. Investors should monitor US-China policy developments and PBOC easing measures as key swing factors.
