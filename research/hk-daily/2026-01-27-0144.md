## 💡 Market Implications

**For Traders:**

**Key themes:** The market is navigating conflicting signals - domestic policy support versus external headwinds. Tech sector weakness presents tactical risk, but selective opportunities are emerging in property and EV sectors.

**Actionable insights:**
- **Tech exposure:** Remain cautious on broad tech exposure given HSI breaking 26,500 support. However, quality names like Alibaba and Tencent showing resilience on earnings/buybacks may offer relative safety
- **Property sector:** Morgan Stanley upgrade and easing expectations create near-term bounce potential after multi-year decline - watch for confirmation
- **EV/New Energy:** BYD and sector peers benefiting from strong sales data - momentum trade remains intact
- **Defensive positioning:** Small-cap weakness and Fed hawkishness suggest maintaining defensive tilt until clarity emerges

**Levels to watch:**
- HSI: 26,500 now key support/resistance after break - need reclaim for bullish reversal
- Tech Index: Monitor for stabilization before adding exposure
- Property names: Track policy announcements for confirmation of upgrade thesis

**Risk factors:** US-China trade tensions remain primary overhang; Fed rate path uncertainty; mainland economic data
